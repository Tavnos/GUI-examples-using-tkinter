Commented series of possible ways setting up a graphical user interface with tkinter 

The tutorial is about calculating the volume of a sphere from a given radius.
Along with the A-Z implementation and refinement of a graphical user interface
around it, made with the awesomely built in, tkinter + numpy packages.
Going through this is recommended if you are new at using tkinter. 
The other examples showing the diversity of possibilities, and perhaps inspire.

Enjoy.
